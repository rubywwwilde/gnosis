        <b>Alice</b> was beginning to get <em>very</em> tired of sitting by her
        sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
        peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
        conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice
        “without pictures or conversations?” So she was considering in her own
        <b>mind</b> (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very
        sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would
        be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when
        suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
