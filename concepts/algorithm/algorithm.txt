CONCEPT Algorithm {
  > Well defined computational procedure that takes input and produces output in a finite amount of time.

  PARAMETERS {
    INPUT := Value or set of values
    OUTPUT := Value or set of values
  }

  PROPOSITIONS {
    Algorithm is a TOOL for solving a Computational Problem.

    EXAMPLE SortingProblem {
      Input:  A sequence of n numbers <a1, a2, ..., an>.
      Output:  A permutation (reordering) <a1', a2', ..., an'> of the input sequence such that a1' <= a2' <= ... <= an'.
    }

    An algorithm A is correct if, for every input x in the set of valid instances I:
      • A(x) halts (finishes in finite time)
      • A(x) = f(x), where f(x) is the correct output for x
    In other words:
      ∀ x ∈ I: A(x) halts and A(x) = f(x)
  }
}
